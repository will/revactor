# Any class can be "actorized" by extending it with the Actorize module:
#
#  class MyClass
#    extend Actorize
#  end
#
# This will create MyClass.spawn and MyClass.spawn_link instance methods.
# Now you can create instances of your class which run inside Actors:
#
#  actor = MyClass.spawn
#
# Actorize defines method_missing for the Actor object, and will delegate
# any method calls to the Actor to MyClass's call method.  This method
# should be defined with the following signature:
#
#  class MyClass
#    extend Actorize
#    
#    def self.call(actor, meth, *args)
#      ...
#    end
#  end
#
# The call method receives the actor the call was made on, the method that
# was invoked, and the arguments that were passed.  You can then write a
# simple RPC mechanism to send a message to the actor and receive a response:
#  
#  actor << [:call, Actor.current, meth, *args]
#  Actor.receive do |filter|
#    filter.when(T[:call_reply, actor]) { |_, _, response| response }
#  end
# 
# Using this approach, you can mix the synchronous approach of Objects with
# the asynchronous approach of Actors, and effectively duck type Actors
# to Objects.
