# Actors are lightweight concurrency primitives which communicate via message
# passing.  Each actor has a mailbox which it scans for matching messages.
# An actor sleeps until it receives a message, at which time it scans messages
# against its filter set and then executes appropriate callbacks.
#
# The Actor class is defined in the global scope in hopes of being generally
# useful for Ruby 1.9 users while also attempting to be as compatible as
# possible with the Omnibus and Rubinius Actor implementations.  In this way it 
# should be possible to run programs written using Revactor to on top of other
# Actor implementations.
